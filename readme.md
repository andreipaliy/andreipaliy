## 💡 About Me

I'm a frontend developer with 4+ years of experience delivering robust, scalable solutions across browsers and devices. I've worked in Agile teams ranging from 3 to 40 people on large-scale projects — both remotely and on-site.

I focus on usability, performance, and business value while taking ownership across the full development cycle — from idea to production. I’ve helped build design systems, optimize bundle sizes, and improve loading speeds. My strong CS background and curiosity allow me to contribute beyond the frontend when needed (DevOps, backend, UI/UX).

I value clean code, sharp UX, and results that make sense.
